The Matthews Coach Hire Company Pvt Ltd is Ireland country based daily passenger transport service company and its addressâ€“ Callenberg, Inniskeen, Ireland. The project is an online bus booking and ticket management system for Mathews Coach Hire Pvt. Ltd.  It was created using HTML, PHP, and MySQL.  Only the present website of this company allows passengers to view bus schedules and destinations.  However, by enabling passengers to select their seats, book tickets in advance, and view their booking history, the new system I'm developing will improve things.  Along with checking on their vehicles, bus owners can also view their revenue and passenger data.  Additionally, the system allows users and places to be managed by the administrator, and it allows passengers and bus owners to register and log in.  Using a cutting-edge, effective online platform, this solution expedites operations and simplifies things for customers.
